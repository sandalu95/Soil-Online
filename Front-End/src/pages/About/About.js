            Since its founding in 2023, SOIL has become more than just an online
            store. We've grown into a movement committed to promoting organic
            living worldwide. Based in Australia, we're a symbol of natural and
            sustainable lifestyles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Founded by Sandy and Mia, SOIL offers a curated selection of over
            2,000 organic and natural products sourced from Australia and
            renowned global brands.
          </p>
          <p>
            We advocate for the purity of products, steadfastly believing that
            they should remain untouched by chemicals and toxins. Nature, in its
            pristine form, serves as our guiding principle. Moreover, we proudly
            wear our sustainability badge, recognizing eco-friendly production
            as not just a choice but a necessity for the well-being of our
            planet. And crucially, we are committed to making organic and
            natural goods accessible to all Australians.
